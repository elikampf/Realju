# Why Every Marriage Hits the Wall (And How to Break Through)

*A Torah Guide to Surviving the Post-Honeymoon Reality*

## The Crash No One Warns You About

You stood under the chuppah with the person you were absolutely certain was your soulmate. The engagement was magical. The wedding was perfect. Those first few weeks of marriage felt like floating on clouds.

Then reality hit like a brick wall.

Suddenly, this person you thought you knew so well seems like a stranger. The little things that were "cute" during dating now irritate you. You're having your first real fight, and you're both thinking the same terrifying thought: "Did I make a huge mistake?"

If this sounds familiar, take a deep breath. You're not alone, you didn't marry the wrong person, and your marriage isn't doomed.

**Every couple hits this wall. Every single one.**

## Welcome to Real Life: Why the Bubble Always Pops

The truth that no one tells you before marriage is this: men and women are so fundamentally different that it's actually a miracle when they create a harmonious home together. Think about it—you grew up in different houses, went to different schools, had completely different experiences, and that's before we even consider the biological and hormonal differences between men and women.

During engagement and those first weeks of marriage, you're both running on excitement and adrenaline. You're hyper-motivated to be your absolute best self. You're following every piece of advice from your Chosson and Kallah teachers. You're walking on air.

But here's what happens: slowly, you both start to let your guard down. It usually begins subconsciously, but at some point becomes conscious with the excuse, "This is my home, and I can be myself here." The bad habits you worked so hard to control during dating—throwing clothes on the floor, personal hygiene issues, speaking without thinking—suddenly don't seem so important anymore.

**Then the magic dust disappears, and you both hit the ground hard.**

This usually explodes during your first real fight, often about something completely trivial. And suddenly you're both wondering:

- "I thought we were so similar when we were dating! What happened?"
- "Did I make a big mistake?"
- "I didn't realize he/she was like that. I don't know if I can live like this."

## The Foundation Problem: Treating Marriage Like a Trial Run

Here's where most couples make their critical error. From the very beginning, many approach marriage with a weak commitment. They see it as a "tryout"—"let's see how it goes." These thoughts and attitudes, even if unspoken, undermine the entire foundation of the marriage.

The Gemara teaches us something profound about this. They used to ask a new Chassan: "Matza or Motza?" 

"Matza" means "I found" in the past tense. The pasuk says, "Matza Isha, Matza Tov"—if you found a wife, you found good. Past tense. I already found her; I don't need to search anymore. I'm done. Now that I know she's the one for me, I'm totally committed to making the best life possible. I don't second-guess it. I know it's true. That's when it will be good.

But if the answer is "Motza," it means I'm still finding, still searching, still not sure. The pasuk warns us: "U'Motza Ani Mar Mi'maves, Et Ha'Isha"—life with a wife will be tremendously bitter.

**It's the doubt itself that makes life bitter.**

Married life isn't easy. There are always ups and downs. But for someone not completely dedicated to building a strong home with their spouse, it's exponentially harder because they're starting with a weak foundation full of doubt about whether this person is really the one they should be with.

## The Real Work Begins Now

When the bubble pops and reality sets in, this is actually when the real work of marriage begins. And yes, it is serious work.

Most couples come into marriage expecting it to be a continuation of the engagement high. When that doesn't happen, they panic. But this transition from excitement to real life isn't a bug in the system—it's a feature. This is when you actually start building something real.

Here's what you need to understand: the excitement of engagement and the first weeks of marriage should be viewed as a springboard, not the foundation. Use that momentum to commit yourself completely to each other and to the work ahead.

**This means getting your mindset ready to do difficult things for each other and put the other's needs before your own.**

## The Matza Mindset: Your Mental Revolution

The first and most crucial work happens in your own mind. The commitment to your spouse isn't a one-time choice you made under the chuppah—it needs constant review and strengthening.

You need to train your mind to think: "I am here to stay. I am going to make this work, no matter what. I am totally committed to you and our relationship."

But these can't just be words you say once and forget. Think of an entrepreneur starting a business—he "sleeps" the business, he "eats" the business, he "breathes" the business. That's how you need to view your marriage.

**Your relationship with your spouse is the most important part of your life. You have to live that way.**

This mental shift isn't just motivational fluff—it's practical wisdom. When you approach problems from a place of absolute commitment, you find solutions. When you approach them from a place of doubt, you find exits.

## What Happens When the Foundation Is Weak

I've seen what happens when couples don't make this mental shift. Let me share a story from my experience:

A young couple came to see me just months after their wedding. They were both good people from good families, but they were struggling. During one of our conversations, the wife mentioned she couldn't leave her parents for more than a few days because she missed them too much.

The husband asked me privately, "Rabbi, is this normal? Why can't she be away from her parents for even a month? We're married—she doesn't live in their house anymore."

I explained to him that this was actually a sign that their kesher (connection) wasn't as strong as he thought. When a woman doesn't feel completely secure and connected with her husband, she naturally gravitates back to where she does feel secure—often her parents' home.

This wasn't about her being immature or him being inadequate. It was about recognizing they still had work to do in building that unshakeable bond where she feels completely safe and connected with him.

The good news? They were both willing to do the work. They learned that building that level of trust and connection takes time, patience, and consistent effort from both sides.

## The Trust Foundation: Why Honesty Matters More Than Peace

One of the biggest mistakes couples make when trying to "keep the peace" is thinking that small lies or omissions don't matter. I've seen marriages seriously damaged by what people thought were harmless deceptions.

Here's the truth: lying for shalom bayis is not a good idea. It's much better to tell the truth, take the temporary hit, and build up genuine trust than to create a story that preserves momentary peace but undermines long-term connection.

Why? Because if you do it once, you'll do it again. And again. Eventually, your spouse will start to feel something is off, even if they can't pinpoint what. And once either spouse feels "I can't really trust the other one," that is poison—outright poison—for a marriage.

I've seen couples divorce over hidden things that built up over time. Trust, once broken, is incredibly difficult to rebuild. The foundation of marriage is exclusivity—not just physical, but emotional and psychological as well.

## The Exclusivity Principle: The Soil of Marriage

Here's one of the most important concepts for modern couples to understand: marriage is built on exclusivity. When you stood under the chuppah, you said "Harei At Mekudeshet Li"—you are only for me. This creates an exclusive relationship that becomes the soil from which everything else grows.

But exclusivity isn't just about avoiding obvious problems. It's about understanding that if you're getting emotional satisfaction, friendship, or connection from someone else—even in small ways—you're taking that away from your marriage.

This is particularly relevant for people working in mixed environments. That friendly colleague who always makes you feel good? That family member you confide in when you're frustrated with your spouse? These relationships, even when completely innocent, can slowly drain energy from your marriage.

I remember a man telling me about working in an office where a female colleague always smiled at him and seemed genuinely interested in his day. "It's nothing inappropriate, Rabbi," he said. "But when my wife and I fight, I find myself looking forward to that interaction at work because it makes me feel good."

That's exactly the problem. Your marriage should be where you get that validation and connection. When you start getting it elsewhere, even innocently, you're weakening the exclusive bond that makes marriage work.

## The Daily Practice: Building Unshakeable Commitment

So how do you actually build this unshakeable foundation? It starts with a daily practice of reinforcing your commitment mentally and emotionally.

**Step 1: Daily Reflection**
Every single day, take time to remind yourself: "My wife/husband is a part of me. We are two halves of the same soul. Hashem created us this way specifically." Write it down. Think about it. Make it your mantra.

The more you do this exercise, the more this idea becomes implanted in your heart, and your love and desire to give to your spouse becomes stronger and more natural.

**Step 2: Reframe the Challenges**
When difficulties arise—and they will—train yourself to see them differently. Instead of thinking "Why is my spouse doing this to me?" think "How is Hashem using this situation to help us grow closer?"

Remember: Hashem sent you this specific person with these specific traits because together, you create a complete unit. The things that challenge you about your spouse aren't bugs—they're features designed to help you both grow.

**Step 3: Focus on Your Own Work**
The most important thing you can control is your own effort. Put in 100% regardless of whether your spouse is matching your effort. This isn't about keeping score—it's about building something real.

Even if you don't see immediate changes, keep going. Consistency in effort eventually wins over the other person. And when both sides are giving their all, that's when magic happens.

## The Long View: Why the Hard Work Is Worth It

Building a strong marriage isn't just about personal happiness—though that's certainly part of it. You're building something that becomes the foundation for everything else in your life. Your home is where you accomplish your real life goals, not just where you rest between other activities.

Think of it this way: putting your main focus and effort on things outside your home is like building a tall building on a weak foundation. Eventually, everything comes crashing down.

But when you build your marriage as the strong core of your life, everything else—your career, your parenting, your community involvement—becomes more stable and successful.

## Your Action Plan: Starting Monday Morning

Here's what you're going to do starting this week:

**Week 1: Commitment Clarity**
- Write down your commitment to your spouse. Make it specific and personal.
- Read it every morning for seven days.
- When challenges arise, refer back to this commitment before reacting.

**Week 2: Trust Building**
- Identify any areas where you've been less than completely honest, even about small things.
- Have a conversation with your spouse about building complete transparency.
- Commit to telling the truth even when it's uncomfortable.

**Week 3: Exclusivity Audit**
- Honestly assess where you might be getting emotional satisfaction outside your marriage.
- Redirect that energy back into your relationship with your spouse.
- Have a conversation about what exclusive emotional intimacy means to both of you.

**Week 4: Daily Practice**
- Implement the daily reflection exercise.
- Start each day by reminding yourself that your spouse is literally part of you.
- End each day by identifying one thing you're grateful for about your spouse.

## The Bottom Line

Every marriage hits the wall. The couples who make it are the ones who see the wall not as a dead end, but as the beginning of the real work. They understand that the engagement excitement was just the appetizer—the main course is building something real together.

Yes, it's difficult. Yes, it requires work. But it's the most important work you'll ever do. And when you approach it with complete commitment, absolute honesty, and exclusive dedication to each other, you'll build something unshakeable.

Your marriage can not only survive hitting the wall—it can become stronger because of it.
