# Bringing the Divine Into Your Marriage: The Missing Partner

*How to Transform Your Relationship by Inviting Hashem In*

## The Contradiction That Changes Everything

I'm going to tell you something that might seem contradictory at first, but understanding it will transform your marriage—and your life.

On one hand, I've written about commitment and putting in hard work to build a strong marriage. Marriage requires serious effort, difficult choices, and constant dedication.

But I've also said that it takes a miracle for a man and woman to live together in a happy, peaceful home.

So which is it? Hard work or a miracle?

**The answer is both—and that's the key to everything.**

You need to understand this answer, believe it, internalize it, and then live it. Doing this will change your marriage completely.

The answer is that there's actually a third partner in your home—if you let Him in. This third partner brings with Him peace, love, and happiness. He wants to come, but you have to want Him there too.

**That third partner is Hashem.**

## The Partnership You Never Knew You Needed

Here's what most couples don't realize: Hashem is the one who split the sea to bring every husband and wife together. You only stood under the chuppah with your spouse because Hashem orchestrated every detail to put you there, together. The meeting, the dating, the engagement, the decision to marry—none of it was coincidence.

Now you need to bring Him into your home as an active partner.

**Hashem will provide the miracle you need, but you need to do the hard work to make Him feel welcome.**

This isn't just nice spiritual advice—it's practical wisdom that addresses the core challenge every couple faces. Remember what we established: men and women are so fundamentally different that creating harmony between them naturally requires supernatural assistance.

You can work incredibly hard on communication techniques, compromise strategies, and conflict resolution—and you should. But without the Divine dimension, you're essentially trying to perform surgery with gardening tools.

## The First Step: Absolute Clarity About Your Partner

The foundation of inviting Hashem into your marriage starts with true emunah—complete faith and clarity that it was Hashem who sent you your partner to help you reach your life's mission.

**Hashem doesn't make mistakes. Trust Him.**

This isn't just a comforting thought—it's a practical reframe that changes how you see every challenge in your marriage. When you have a fight, when your spouse does something that drives you crazy, when you're wondering how you're going to make this work, you can return to this bedrock truth: Hashem specifically chose this person for you.

Once you truly know that Hashem sent you your soulmate for this world and the next, you also know you can fully trust Him and invite Him into your home.

But how exactly do you do that?

## The Secret Power of Friday Night

There's a mystical power that a woman has to bring peace to her home through lighting candles on Friday night. Our sages teach that shalom bayis comes through that candlelight—but there's something much deeper happening than most people realize.

Light represents seeing something clearly. When we "shine light" on an issue, we gain clarity about how to handle it calmly and thoughtfully. A person in darkness is confused and unsure of their path. Someone with light has a clear vision ahead.

**The Friday night Shabbos lights are the lights that bring in the Shabbos Queen—the Shechinah.**

When Hashem comes into your home, He brings royalty and everything that comes with it. It's the source of all blessing. Within that candlelight, a couple can see a clear vision of how to bring peace into their home.

The light illuminates your understanding that true peace only comes by having Hashem in your home. It brings clarity that if you dedicate your home to be a place where the Shechinah wants to dwell, you will have shalom bayis.

**The first step is complete clarity that this is what you want more than anything else.**

This must become your vision, your goal. Everything else builds from here.

## Your Guiding Light: Understanding Your Purpose

Now let's connect the practical to the spiritual. Your guiding light is understanding that Hashem brought you together to create a home that forms part of the core of the Jewish nation. This is why you got married—not just for personal happiness, but to fulfill a cosmic purpose.

When you internalize that this is your mission, you realize that Hashem sent you the perfect partner to accomplish this goal. Your spouse is the other half of yourself, specifically designed to fill in the parts you're lacking, and vice versa. Together, you create the complete unit that becomes the foundation of your home.

**Here's the revolutionary insight: all the difficult points about your spouse are actually linked to creating that complete unit.**

When you remain focused on this spiritual purpose, you realize that it's specifically because your spouse has certain traits—even the challenging ones—that you have the opportunity to bond into one unit.

But when you lose sight of this bigger picture, you start approaching marriage with selfish expectations: "How can I get the most out of my marriage?" When you're stuck in that darkness, you see your spouse's traits as bothersome and annoying, creating distance between you.

**The difference is seeing your life through the right light.**

## The Most Powerful Tool: Prayer

Once you've established Hashem and His will as the foundation of your home, the first and strongest practical step you can take is prayer.

Our sages teach that a person might be brilliant, strong, and talented in many areas, but they'll only see success if Hashem wants them to succeed. So alongside all the hard work necessary to build a happy home, you need to ask Hashem to make it successful.

**I cannot overemphasize how important this is.**

It's tragic when people will try every possible path to find the solution they're seeking, yet they don't even consider praying for success.

Every single day, you should ask Hashem for His help to bring shalom bayis. Tefilah is incredibly powerful—you must tap into it.

Here's what this looks like practically:

**General prayers:** Ask Hashem to bring peace and love into your home and into your hearts.

**Specific prayers:** Ask Hashem to help you make deeper, stronger connections with your spouse.

**Situational prayers:** Do you have an important topic to discuss? Something sensitive? Ask Hashem for help to say it the right way so it leads to closeness, not distance.

## Making It Personal: The Heart of Prayer

Prayer isn't supposed to be generic. It's called Avodah Shebalev—service of the heart. Make your prayers personal for your specific circumstances:

- "Hashem, help me express topic X to my wife/husband the right way so it brings us together rather than pulling us apart."
- "Please Hashem, put the right words in my mouth to connect to my spouse."
- "Hashem, help me every day to see the good in my spouse, and for him/her to see the good in me."

**These words should be your daily companion.**

I guarantee that if you make personal prayers like these part of your daily routine, you will see significant changes in your home, regardless of whether you've been married for three months or thirty years.

Here's why this works on two levels:

1. **You get actual help from Hashem.** Hashem wants you to have shalom bayis—you just need to ask for His assistance.

2. **You're making Hashem an active partner in your home.** By turning to Him regularly, you're inviting His presence into your daily life.

## Where Hashem Wants to Dwell: Bringing Torah Home

The sages teach a parable of a king who marries off his only daughter. The king is sad about being separated from his daughter, so he asks his new son-in-law to make a room in his home where the king can always come and be close to his daughter.

This represents the building of the Mishkan in the desert. The king is Hashem. He gave His only daughter—the Torah—to the Jewish people, but He can't be separated from it. So He tells us to build a place where He can be close to the Torah.

**The same is true for your individual home. The more Torah you have in your home, the more Hashem will be present.**

Learning Torah at home—beyond what you do in the Beis Medrash—is fundamental to building your home and bringing shalom bayis into it.

### Practical Ways to Bring Torah Into Your Home:

**Share Divrei Torah at meals:** This isn't just a nice spiritual addition—it transforms the meal into an uplifting experience. It's like eating from Hashem's table. Choose content that's appropriate and enjoyable for everyone.

**Study Halacha together:** There are so many topics related to running a home and the relationship between husband and wife that require constant review:
- Hilchos Shabbos
- Kashrus
- Lashon Hara  
- Taharas Hamishpacha

**Learn Hashkafa or Mussar together:** Spend a few minutes each day strengthening your connection to Hashem and to each other through learning.

When Hashem sees that you care about bringing Torah into your home, He will want to join you there.

## The Two Essential Roles: Creating the Perfect Vessel

When Hashem gave the Torah to Bnei Yisrael, He established two critical aspects for its acceptance:

**First:** The Torah must be taken as a way of life. Learning Torah is the greatest act a person can do. This should be how we spend every free moment, as we say daily: "We will rejoice in the words of Your Torah... for they are our life and the length of our days."

**Second:** Creating an atmosphere that allows Torah learning to thrive. All the details of our lives should enhance and encourage a life dedicated to Torah and its principles.

In marriage, this translates to complementary roles:

**The husband's responsibility:** Bring Torah into the home. Be the one who initiates learning, shares Torah thoughts, and creates an atmosphere of spiritual growth.

**The wife's responsibility:** Make the home ready to accept the Torah. Create an environment where Torah can flourish—one of peace, organization, and spiritual receptivity.

When Hashem gave the Torah, He turned to the women first, asking them to accept the role of creating homes that would be the vessel Torah needs to flourish. He knew this was critical to ensure that Torah learning would reach its true potential.

**Each role is crucial, and each partner needs the other to reach the ultimate goal.**

Through working together and becoming a complete unit, you can bring both the Torah and the Shechinah into your home.

## The Ways of Peace: Your Biblical Blueprint

The pasuk tells us that "all the ways of the Torah lead to peace." This is the goal Hashem set for us: bring peace into the world, and you'll bring Me into the world too.

Our first step is bringing peace into our own homes, which will bring the Shechinah into our homes.

**Your prime examples are Avraham and Sarah.**

The relationship between Avraham and Sarah was the closest of any couple in history, our sages teach. Together they reached complete shlemus—completion. They were truly one.

This was clearly visible in their tent: the candle that miraculously burned all week, the blessing in their bread, and the cloud that hovered over their tent. Hashem's presence was unmistakably there because of their level of connection.

This didn't happen automatically. The Torah is full of examples of the love and respect they had for each other, each one sacrificing and being moser nefesh for the other even when it was especially difficult.

**Where there is love and peace, Hashem says, "I want to be with them."**

Shalom bayis isn't just good advice—it's the path to fulfilling the purpose of creation. This is so important to Hashem that He's willing to erase His own name to bring peace between a husband and wife.

Anyone working to strengthen their shalom bayis is working together with Hashem and will merit tremendous blessing in all areas of life.

## Real-Life Application: When One Partner Isn't "Doing Their Part"

Here's a question many couples ask: "What if I'm doing my part to invite Hashem into our home, but my spouse isn't doing theirs?"

This can be incredibly frustrating. You might find yourself thinking:
- "Why doesn't he get out of bed for learning?"
- "Why isn't there food when I come home after working hard all day?"
- "Doesn't she realize how much effort I'm putting in?"

The answer lies in understanding that besides doing your own part, you have the ability to build up your spouse as well.

**Hashem specifically put you together because you're the perfect fit to help each other reach your potential.**

Instead of expressing anger or frustration when your spouse falls short, realize that Hashem is showing you exactly where your job is to positively encourage and help your spouse.

Positivity is crucial. Someone who feels good about themselves accomplishes more. When your spouse feels loved and respected for the good things they do and for their inherent potential, it becomes much easier for them to fulfill that potential.

This is the path every couple should use to build each other up and together create a bayis ne'eman b'Yisrael.

## The Bottom Line: Hard Work Plus Miracles

Building a marriage that includes Hashem as an active partner isn't about replacing practical effort with spiritual bypassing. It's about recognizing that the practical work you're already doing becomes exponentially more effective when it's grounded in spiritual purpose and supported by Divine assistance.

Yes, you still need to work on communication. Yes, you still need to be patient, kind, and willing to compromise. Yes, you still need to address practical issues and relationship challenges.

But when you do all of that within the framework of a three-way partnership with Hashem, everything changes. You're no longer just two imperfect people trying to figure it out on your own. You're two souls working together with the Creator of the universe to build something holy.

**The miracle isn't that your problems disappear—it's that you gain the wisdom, strength, and perspective to handle them together.**

Your home can become a place where Hashem wants to dwell. Your marriage can become a source of blessing not just for you, but for the entire world.

The invitation is always open. The question is: are you ready to invite Him in?
