But Rabbi Klapper offers a powerful truth: the fight doesn't mean you're brokenâ€”it means you're alive. Hashem designed this world with challenges so that we could grow through them. That includes the taiva itself. It's not inherently evilâ€”it's meant to become holy. So instead of asking, \"Why do I have this?\" the real question is, \"What am I meant to do with it?\"...",

Other forms awaken something deeperâ€”reminding you that you're too valuable to live beneath your greatness.
